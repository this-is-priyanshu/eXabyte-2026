   This is the about page, created just as an example

  <div class="navbar">
   <a href="index.html">
    Home

   <a class="active" href="about.html">
    About
   </a>

   Ofcourse the data won't be exactly the same but for the perposes of
demonstration this works fine, Significan't reduction in friction.
However the problem is during normal development creating a dist build
everytime is time consuming and annoying, we will need to get a
solution for that problem
  </main>
  <div>
   <strong>
    This is a line just to distinguish between thingberts
   </strong>
   Normally we would sanitize out the html, but we won't do that in this case
because some inline css could be nessesary.

just build the dist and botch in it XD.
